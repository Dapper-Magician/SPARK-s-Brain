Occult concepts are great at holding vast ideas within a single symbol. This is essentially relational and meta-relational information compression. I would also like to build AI architecture based on Planetary Kamea Squares, structure OS's off of Planetary Energies. Ex. An OS switches through 'Modes or Models' based off of the planets for particular tasks just as modern computers allow multiple workstations. This computer is kind of a computer that has individual LLMS's that instantiate their OS's through a technology similar to Virtual Computing."

As in, if I get an idea, I need to know what it takes to create that, what is available, concrete recommendations with a priority on open source, ratings/values of technologies+frameworks+approaches so I can pick the best and then detailed outlines to have a structured goal that can be solid. When a roadmap isn't solid for me I invariably end up trying to 'upgrade it' or change it in some way. My innovation tends to be my downfall. With a strict outline, I can procure the necessary materials, set up the work environments and marshal my AI assistants (like you) to begin coding and before we know it, they will be done."

      "content": "I see certain symbols being instantiated in a storage/database environment, whether a graph database like Neo4j or a vector database like Pinecone, or some other kind of new database, maybe 3D with AR. You can see all the relational concepts and follow them to see their intersections. If you generate another symbol and instantiate it in the symbol-relational datazone you're currently viewing, it can show you the files/information in a new light. Especially if each symbol has pre-programmable modules and parameters so that it can be modulated to one's need. Also, if a storage base can convert high-resolution, tiny images of things like sigils that are drawn in a way similar to QR codes, then a storage drive, server, or database/data lake can encode information pictographically which could provide at a glance information capture to any permitted system holding those capabilities instead of language having to be understood and rendered by the computer. For LLM's they could understand the symbols through representational logic instead of context words which force LLM's to centralize themselves in certain cultural hegemony's and force everyone to adopt a standard. This doesn't lend itself towards decentralization."

I need dynamic note collection, the ability to make voice notes, transcribe speech, talk to an AI to draw what I am imagining. 
I need a bot for Dall-E and Midjourney to build art directly into it. 
I need an API key organizer and clean methods of delivery for various API's to stream their service to the suite. 
I need a file organization system, a mind mapping tool, and a cross-service data lake, which can store all of my information from various storages. 
I need the ability to stream app service into windows I can generate for apps like evernote, todoist, and notion. 
I need a coding interface, something like Brackets, and then eventually something morecomplicated where it can be a full Development Environment that can load LLM API service into a sidebar for a coding AI assistant. 
For all of my AI aspects within, I imagine that I will be able to deploy my AI Persona within a running prompt .

Mindmapping can go two ways. I can run an LLM API call through my current active workstation and with embedding and semantic search I can label all of my concepts and extract those to the mindmapping files. 
When I click on the mind map tab/swatch/widget i can load up that information to the file. With an AI assistant, I can get advice on how to categorize this. 
But first it would be like a typical mind map program which allows deploying shapes, connecting lines, naming each structure, giving them colors, so on and so forth

For bots, I'd like them to execute premade scripts that set up document/excel sheet/task list/code script templates and boilerplates as well as act as data retrieval from local storage, databases, pdf and web scraping, using natural language to summarize language. Things like this. 
For AI assistant, it would be coding within an IDE or container, offering insight into information, utilize certain applications, edit+correct my work, build and edit the code of my bots, take in larger swaths of information and display outlines for hour, day, week, bi-weekly period, month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12, months etc which would be edited upon achievement of my goals and milestones. 
They would help me continuously refine my ideas, update my objectives and make them more concrete, record my data easier and store it.
